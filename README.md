## My process

### Built with
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox to create a responsive design.

```css
.card__body {
    padding: 0 24px 24px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about flexbox and grid to create more complex layouts. Implementing HTML5 semantic elements is also something I want to focus on.
